        <h3 id="about">About Me</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="right" style="text-align: justify;">My name is Muhammad Zaid, and I am a passionate aspiring Web Developer currently on a journey to master the art of creating digital experiences. My fascination with how the internet works led me to dive deep into the world of coding, starting with the core building blocks of the web. Having successfully mastered HTML, I have built a solid foundation in structuring content that is both semantic and accessible.
        </p>
        <p class="left" style="text-align: justify; background-color: #f0f0f0;">My primary goal is to become a Professional Web Developer, capable of turning complex ideas into functional, user-friendly websites. I believe that a great developer is not just someone who writes code, but someone who solves problems and creates value for users. This vision drives me to spend hours every day refining my skills and exploring new technologies that push the boundaries of what is possible online.
To achieve my goals, I have adopted a modern and proactive approach to learning. I utilize a variety of online platforms and websites to stay updated with industry standards. By following expert documentation and interactive tutorials, I ensure that my coding practices are up-to-date and align with the best practices used by developers globally.</p>

<p class="right" style="text-align: justify;">YouTube has been an invaluable mentor in my journey. It allows me to learn from world-class developers through visual demonstrations and real-world projects. From understanding layout design to debugging complex issues, these video resources have helped me bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, allowing me to build projects with confidence.
In addition to traditional resources, I actively leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to accelerate my learning curve. Using AI tools helps me understand complex concepts more clearly, optimize my code, and explore innovative ways to solve development challenges. This tech-forward mindset allows me to work smarter and stay ahead in an ever-evolving digital landscape.
</p>

<p class="left" style="text-align: justify; background-color: #f0f0f0;">Currently, I am focusing my energy on mastering CSS to bring my HTML structures to life with beautiful designs and responsive layouts. My journey is fueled by a commitment to continuous growth and a desire to contribute to the tech community. I am excited to take on new challenges and transform my passion for web development into a professional career.</p>

        <p class="right" style="text-align: justify;">My Technical Skills
As a dedicated learner in the field of web development, I believe in building a foundation that is both strong and scalable. My technical toolkit is currently centered around the core technologies that power the modern web. I focus on writing clean, semantic, and efficient code to ensure that every project I work on is optimized for performance and user experience.
Mastering HTML (The Architecture)
I have achieved full proficiency in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which I consider the backbone of any successful web project. My expertise includes working with semantic HTML5 elements, which not only help in structuring the content correctly but also play a vital role in SEO and accessibility. Understanding how to organize data, images, and links properly allows me to create a solid framework upon which beautiful designs can be built</p>

Advancing in CSS (The Aesthetics)
Currently, I am deeply immersed in mastering CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). My goal is to transform basic HTML structures into visually stunning and highly interactive interfaces. I am learning how to control layouts, typography, and color schemes to create websites that are not just functional but also aesthetically pleasing. My focus is on understanding the CSS Box Model, positioning, and the art of making designs that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.</p>
